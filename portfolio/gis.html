    GIS Dynamic's flagship product, Go iLawn, was in need of stack update and a visual refresh that would meet the changing demands of the landscapers who use it to rapidly measure properties and quote them. Key among these was a need to make it possible to take operations on the road and draw these measurements on tablets and phones, which is no small feat for an app that involves drawing.

  <h3>Keeping old users happy and welcoming in the new ones</h3>
  <p class="is-two-columns">
    Go iLawn and its sister products commanded a lot of loyalty from its existing customers, so keeping tools and their placement familiar was the first step I took when laying out the UI. With expansion of market share being a goal, however, onboarding a new slate of users when the wealth of walkthrough videos only existed for the previous version of the software was a little more tricky. While keeping UI elements that need to be on screen at any time spare was key to faciliate mobile use, we introduced contextual help cues for when various tools were active. I also worked with the client to map out a walkthrough, then used a combination of JavaScript and SVG masking to simulate software use and guide a new user through the process of measuring a property.
