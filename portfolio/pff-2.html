    <p>Pro Football Focus then came back to us to craft a data collection application intended to replace the system of spreadsheets they kept on Microsoft Access database. With the provision of fine-grain game data being their bread and butter, there were quite the number of form fields to grapple with. I worked closely with company analysts to fine-tune the flow from datapoint to datapoint over the course of a play. When everything was said and done, analysts were wrapping up the collection of a given game's data within an hour of a game's completion, not days.</p>

  <h3>Cutting through commercials</h3>
  <p class="is-two-columns">With as arduous as the data collection process is, making the process of entering data as it becomes apparent to an analyst as seamless as possible is key. We established a form field order and tab continuity consistent with their process, and also introduced a system of hotkeys to allow for play traversal in order to make any updates to the data during breaks in play. All of this translated into time saved <i>not</i> having to fight both the software and the DVR.</p>
