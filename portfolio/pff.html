  <p>Our initial task was to channel the game data that Pro Football Focus provides to the production team of Sunday Night Football to drive commentary into an attractive report that could be used digitally or even printed.</p>
  <p>The team had managed to blast through the report app ahead of schedule, and we were able to craft a consumer-facing app that would provide a more limited slice of the data for football hobbyists.</p>
